PHP, Mysql, javascript programming. At leftclick I worked primarily on two related projects. One was implementing a generic search framework & interface for a client of Leftclick, which was looking to launch it's on line classifieds. Think multiple search constraints across a broad range of classifieds listings. Faced with a myriad of search options per classifieds & categories, we developed a data driven search framework, which expedited the creation of the User Interface & database queries across this di	verse range of classifieds listings. I also implemented a green-field SSO solution for a client needing Single Sign On across their range of on line presences. I employed extensive functional testing to make sure the application behaved as expected, and kept behaving that way.

## Freelance Experience

### Fremantle Guitar
`August 2018` <br /> `Now`

I worked with Fremantle Guitar to augment their customer invoice tracking system which was utilising airtable. Send out emails to clients when invoices are due. **Ruby**

I am currently working on a booking system for Fremantle Guitar, which integrates with their unique needs (parents, children, term based subscriptions). This also involves Google drive intergration for video uploads. Google Auth for SSO. **Ruby On Rails**


### Cryptocurrency Exchange Arbitrage
`January 2018` <br /> `June 2018`

I worked with a crypto startup to analyze opportunities presented by exchange rate differences between online cryptocurrency exchanges. Finding round-trip percentage gains by buying and selling on various exchanges.

### ABC Wall Removers

I developed a quoting website for a client to create estimates for jobs. This was generally accessed via an web app & on IPad. Once the estimate was created, the client could then send the estimate details across to his invoice2go invoicing app, which takes care of generating a PDF invoice for clients. This was developed using emberjs, a rails backend which served json, and the bootstrap framework for the design.

### Integrated Natural Systems

I delivered a website for Integrated Natural Systems. This is a static website hosted on amazon s3. The client wanted a clean, minimal look for their website to complement with the images & gallery featuring photos of nature. Please note, this website has been taken down as the client is working in a position that creates a conflict of interest. However I can provide a link to the website upon request.

### House Of Snowball
I developed an ecommerce shop for houseofsnowball.com. This was created using rails, and integrates with Stripe for the payment processing. Created using haml, sass & javascript. It is a fairly traditional Rails application.
