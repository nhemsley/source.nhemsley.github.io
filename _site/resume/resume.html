<p>PHP, Mysql, javascript programming. At leftclick I worked primarily on two related projects. One was implementing a generic search framework &amp; interface for a client of Leftclick, which was looking to launch it’s on line classifieds. Think multiple search constraints across a broad range of classifieds listings. Faced with a myriad of search options per classifieds &amp; categories, we developed a data driven search framework, which expedited the creation of the User Interface &amp; database queries across this di	verse range of classifieds listings. I also implemented a green-field SSO solution for a client needing Single Sign On across their range of on line presences. I employed extensive functional testing to make sure the application behaved as expected, and kept behaving that way.</p>
