          <p>I developed a quoting website for a client to create estimates for jobs. This was generally accessed via an web app &amp; on IPad. Once the estimate was created, the client could then send the estimate details across to his invoice2go invoicing app, which takes care of generating a PDF invoice for clients. This was developed using emberjs, a rails backend which served json, and the bootstrap framework for the design.</p>

          <p>I delivered a website for Integrated Natural Systems. This is a static website hosted on amazon s3. The client wanted a clean, minimal look for their website to complement with the images &amp; gallery featuring photos of nature. Please note, this website has been taken down as the client is working in a position that creates a conflict of interest. However I can provide a link to the website upon request.</p>
