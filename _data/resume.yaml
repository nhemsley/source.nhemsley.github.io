  description: I developed a quoting website for a client to create estimates for
    jobs. This was generally accessed via an web app & on IPad. Once the estimate
    was created, the client could then send the estimate details across to his invoice2go
    invoicing app, which takes care of generating a PDF invoice for clients. This
    was developed using emberjs, a rails backend which served json, and the bootstrap
    framework for the design.

  description: I delivered a website for Integrated Natural Systems. This is a
    static website hosted on amazon s3. The client wanted a clean, minimal look
    for their website to complement with the images & gallery featuring photos of
    nature. Please note, this website has been taken down as the client is working
    in a position that creates a conflict of interest. However I can provide a link
    to the website upon request.
