    I developed a quoting website for ABC Wall Removers to create estimates for
    jobs. This was generally accessed via an web app & on IPad. Once the estimate
    was created, the client could then send the estimate details across to his invoice2go
    invoicing app, which takes care of generating a PDF invoice for clients. This
    was developed using emberjs, a rails backend which served json, and the bootstrap
    framework for the design.
