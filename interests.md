## Interests

I am looking to broaden my experience in Ruby, Postgres, and Javascript front end development (Vue & Vuex, React & Redux et al.), and bring a sound working knowledge of container-based devops, working with Docker and AWS in the past, but also having an eye on Kubernetes and GCP. 

If I am working within your organisation, I will strive to adhere to Test Driven Design fundamentals & workflows. The peace of mind that a thorough & incisive test harness brings to a team is indispensible to delivering an agile, feature complete & correct solution to stakeholders.

I have worked with various Google API's (Google places, Google drive, Permissions API), and am comfortable working with JSON based API's, aware of the challenges and tradeoffs this brings.

My natural environment is within a pry/byebug session, debugging the internals of a Rails application, or whichever gem currently seems to be misbehaving.

I have a deep understanding of Javascript, prototypes, dynamic scoping, ES6, build time tools (webpacker, rollup) and everything else required to get front-end working, and keep it that way.

I am also interested in Flutter, which looks to be a promising technology for targeting heterogenous smartphone environments within one technology stack. 

## Current Interests

I generally keep an eye on where current trends are going, and which technologies are .

* Flutter apps, because why not target multiple mobile platforms.
* eBPF, the virtual machine within the Linux Kernel. This is an interesting development, enabling observability superpowers within Linux.
* Docker, manage deployment environments within your repository. Very nice tool, but it appears to be ceding to:
* Kubernetes, This is on my todo list.
